<h3><strong>Portfolio</strong></h3>
A portfolio website containing the key information that highlights me as a Front-End Developer and encourages others to collaborate with me. The site is built using React, with Redux used for state management. Material UI was used for faster development of certain components. The app does not interact with a backend.
